# Overview: Minimal Todo App

A small, minimal todo app to track your todos. My first attempt to work with TypeScript in a React app.

## What user can expect

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states of all interactive elements (filter tabs, checkbox, delete buttons) on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as completed
- Remove todos if they wish

# My process

(Short decription of my process)

## Built with

- React v17.0.2
- TypeScript v4.2.3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS - CSS pre-processor

## What I learned

- ContextAPI to prevent props drillings between components of different levels
- CSS animation with keyframes
- Apply TypeScript to this project by defining type in each function component

## Continued development

I am still working on this project and updating it continuously. Some of the features I am planning to work on:

- Toggle dark/light mode
- Drag/drop todo to arrange the list

## Useful resources

- TypeScript for JavaScript Programmer [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html] - This help me understand basic types and how to apply TypeScript to this project
